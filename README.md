# Chess in Java
Primitive chess written by me.

## Used to create
- InteliJ IDEA Community 2021.1.1
- JDK 16.0.1

## Guide
**1.** Run application by double click on _Chess.bat_ <br>
**2.** Choose piece to move by typing its field (for example: _a2_ to choose white pawn on field _a2_ ).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**2.1** If you decide to change piece just type **q**. <br>
**3.** Choose field where you want to move selected piece by typing it. If piece can move to selected field it will do it and now it's opponent's move. Otherwise program will be in loop until you type correct field or change piece. <br>
**4.** Game ends when somebody checkmate opponent's King.
